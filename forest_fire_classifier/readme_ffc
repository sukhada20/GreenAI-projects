# WildFire Classifier

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning pipeline for detecting wildfires from images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification and provides an interface for users to predict whether an image contains a wildfire using Gradio.



## Features

- **Dataset Integration**: Automatically downloads datasets for wildfire prediction and waste classification.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a CNN for binary classification.
- **Image Augmentation**: Prepares data using the `ImageDataGenerator` for efficient training.
- **Prediction Interface**: Offers a simple web-based interface using Gradio for real-time predictions.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model to disk for reuse.
